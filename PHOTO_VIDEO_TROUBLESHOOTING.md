# üö® PHOTO & VIDEO LOADING TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

## üîç **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

Your photos and videos are not loading in production after deployment. This is a **file storage and serving configuration issue**.

---

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### ‚úÖ **1. Fixed Static File Serving**

- **Before**: Hardcoded paths that don't work in production
- **After**: Dynamic path resolution based on environment
- **Location**: `api/index.js` - Static file middleware

### ‚úÖ **2. Fixed URL Generation**

- **Before**: Incorrect URL generation for production
- **After**: Proper URL generation with environment detection
- **Location**: `api/config/render-storage.js` - `getFileUrl` method

### ‚úÖ **3. Added Debug Endpoints**

- **New**: `/debug/files` endpoint to troubleshoot storage
- **New**: `/api/performance` endpoint for monitoring
- **New**: Test script for file storage validation

---

## üîß **HOW TO TEST THE FIXES**

### **Step 1: Test File Storage Configuration**

```bash
# Run the test script
node api/test-upload.js
```

### **Step 2: Check Debug Endpoint**

Visit: `https://your-api-domain.com/debug/files`

### **Step 3: Test File Upload**

Try uploading a new image through your app

---

## üéØ **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **The Problem:**

1. **Environment Detection**: Production environment not properly detected
2. **File Paths**: Hardcoded paths that don't exist in Render
3. **URL Generation**: Incorrect URL generation for production
4. **Static Serving**: Wrong directory being served

### **What Was Happening:**

- Files were being uploaded to `/opt/render/project/src/uploads/`
- But the API was trying to serve from wrong paths
- URLs were being generated incorrectly
- Environment variables weren't being used properly

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **CONFIGURATION FIXES**

### **1. Environment Variables (CRITICAL)**

Make sure these are set in your Render deployment:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
RENDER_STORAGE_PATH=/opt/render/project/src/uploads
RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL=https://your-actual-render-url.onrender.com
```

### **2. File Storage Paths**

- **Development**: `./uploads/`
- **Production**: `/opt/render/project/src/uploads/`

### **3. URL Generation**

- **Development**: `http://localhost:5000/uploads/...`
- **Production**: `https://your-domain.onrender.com/uploads/...`

---

## üîç **DEBUGGING STEPS**

### **Step 1: Check Environment**

```bash
# In your production logs, look for:
üåç Environment: production
üìÅ Upload path: /opt/render/project/src/uploads
üåê Base URL: https://your-domain.onrender.com
```

### **Step 2: Check Directory Structure**

```bash
# Verify these directories exist in production:
/opt/render/project/src/uploads/
/opt/render/project/src/uploads/images/
/opt/render/project/src/uploads/gallery/
/opt/render/project/src/uploads/videos/
/opt/render/project/src/uploads/avatars/
```

### **Step 3: Test File Access**

```bash
# Check if files are accessible:
curl https://your-domain.onrender.com/uploads/gallery/test-image.jpg
```

---

## üö® **COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### **Issue 1: "File not found" errors**

**Solution**: Check if directories exist in production

```bash
# Add this to your startup logs
ls -la /opt/render/project/src/uploads/
```

### **Issue 2: Wrong URLs being generated**

**Solution**: Verify environment variables are set

```bash
# Check in production logs
echo $NODE_ENV
echo $RENDER_STORAGE_PATH
echo $RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL
```

### **Issue 3: Static files not being served**

**Solution**: Verify static middleware configuration

```javascript
// This should be in your api/index.js
app.use(
  "/uploads",
  // Production: Serve from Render storage path
  config.NODE_ENV === "production"
    ? express.static("/opt/render/project/src/uploads")
    : express.static(path.join(__dirname, "uploads"))
);
```

---

## üì± **FRONTEND DEBUGGING**

### **1. Check Network Tab**

- Open browser dev tools
- Go to Network tab
- Try to load a photo
- Look for failed requests

### **2. Check Console Errors**

- Look for 404 errors on image URLs
- Check if URLs are being generated correctly

### **3. Test Direct URL Access**

- Copy an image URL from your app
- Paste it directly in browser
- See if it loads

---

## üéØ **EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIXES**

### **‚úÖ What Should Work:**

1. **New uploads**: Should work immediately
2. **Existing files**: Should load if paths are correct
3. **URLs**: Should be properly formatted
4. **Performance**: Should be fast

### **‚ö†Ô∏è What Might Still Need Work:**

1. **Existing files**: May need to be re-uploaded
2. **Database URLs**: May need to be updated
3. **Cache**: May need to be cleared

---

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

### **Before Deploying:**

- [ ] Environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] File paths are correct for production
- [ ] Static file middleware is configured
- [ ] Debug endpoints are accessible

### **After Deploying:**

- [ ] Run `node api/test-upload.js`
- [ ] Check `/debug/files` endpoint
- [ ] Test file upload
- [ ] Verify image loading
- [ ] Check production logs

---

## üîß **IF PROBLEMS PERSIST**

### **1. Check Render Logs**

- Look for file system errors
- Check if directories are being created
- Verify environment variables

### **2. Test File System Access**

```bash
# Add this to your startup
console.log('File system test:');
console.log('Current directory:', process.cwd());
console.log('Upload path exists:', fs.existsSync('/opt/render/project/src/uploads'));
```

### **3. Verify File Permissions**

- Ensure Render has write access to upload directory
- Check if files are being created
- Verify file ownership

---

## üìû **GETTING HELP**

### **Debug Information to Collect:**

1. **Environment variables** from `/debug/files`
2. **File system status** from test script
3. **Network errors** from browser dev tools
4. **Production logs** from Render dashboard

### **Questions to Answer:**

1. Are files being uploaded successfully?
2. Are directories being created?
3. Are URLs being generated correctly?
4. Are static files being served?

---

## üéâ **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

You'll know the fix worked when:

- ‚úÖ **New uploads work** immediately
- ‚úÖ **Existing images load** in the browser
- ‚úÖ **URLs are correct** (no 404 errors)
- ‚úÖ **Performance is fast** (under 2 seconds)
- ‚úÖ **Debug endpoint shows** all green checkmarks

**üéØ The fixes I've implemented should resolve your photo and video loading issues. The problem was in the file storage configuration and URL generation for production environments.**
